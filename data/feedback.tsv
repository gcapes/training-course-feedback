28-Feb-2017			Humanities	Word of mouth	Stata	None	None	Programming in Python	"Discuss a few introductory things in far mode detail. For example, how to save the code we have written, what exactly are the packages that were mentioned (I am not familiar with Python and the ""packages""), who writes those packages (are they ""official"" or users can write whatever they like and make that available to others, posing them at risk (e.g., who developed the 'math' that we imported and from where do we really import it? from the web or from our machine?). Several things were not clear to me. I did not care that much about ""my_var=3"" or about changing elements in a list. In my opinion, these things should have been covered in less time. I felt that the course assumed that the users had prior experience and deep understanding of Python (I don't have), although the content itself was for beginners."	Understand the basics of Python.	Textual Analysis	Please don't take my feedback as negative. The instructor was very nice and effective. I probably had different expectations about the course and I was expecting to understand a few more things about Python in more detail (even how to install it on my laptop and understand several concepts). The information in the slides was helpful to some extent. For someone that has not used Python before, I found it very difficult to understand how Python works in general (although the content of the course was not that difficult -  However, I wanted to get some broader understanding of how Python works). As for the exercises, I did not understand the first exercise. It seemed to be something very simple; yet, it didn't work for me. I expected to see the solutions of all the exercises, but this did not happen. We simply moved on. So, it makes no sense to have exercises if we don't know whether what we have done is correct.	2

I really wish this course should be split in an intro course where we covers basic commands, and an advanced course that focused on data analysis, with the intro course as a prerequisite. I think the crowd here is very diverse, which means everyone has a different expectation and background, and it is hard to move forward.

5-Dec-2017			Humanities	A University email list	Stata	None	None	Data analysis using R	I think initial Topics (introduction, etc) should be done more slowly as it is hard to adjust to a new programme like this at first.

Regression analysis.	I thought the instructor was really good and very good communicator, but to go slower.

I think its a great intro.	I sat 2 R modules at MSc level and they never made sense to me. I've learned more today than I did then, for sure.

An actual introduction to what Python is before diving into coding would have been very useful.	"Coding language - this is not explained in the course and it is very hard to understand what is going on/ complete any of the exercises without this, e.g. explaining what each function did.

When we were asked to try and solve the problems I had no idea where to start as I have no previous knowledge of coding language."	Coding language, an explanation of what functions actually do.	"Most of the course I spent trying to keep up with typing the code - I understood very little of what I was doing and stopping to ask for an explanation or help only meant falling further behind. This didn't feel like an introduction as it requires some understanding of coding language and how to use Python.

A slower course, perhaps over more than one day would have been more beneficial as this set up meant I learned very little as I was constantly left behind by the fast pace and lack of introduction."	2

He went straight into the course without explaining what any of the functions were or what they meant. The majority of the time I just followed along with the episodes/lessons written on the computer. The majority of the lessons were ""put this into the script"" ""this is the answer"". There was no explanation to what the data we were using was about or what it meant when the answers were given.  The entire material was totally rushed through and no one knew what was going on. It would help if the material was already loaded onto the computers as when we logged off the data wouldn't be read properly.  This meant wasting time trying to sort it out and then being lost in the lesson. "	What each function did and why you would use it.	Start from the basics and what they do.

There's already too much. Maybe we could have a bit more time to go over the challenges.  We seem to be moving on very quickly with not a lot of time to think of the answers ourselves.	"I have a lot. I'm sorry in advance for the wall of text.

For some reason it didn't say in the synopsis that it was necessary that we attend the Beginners Python course. In fact it says ""There are no prior knowledge of programming assumed and the course is beginner oriented."" This is not true. This was reinforced when I noticed the beginning of the notes said 'Advanced' Python, which made me worry even before the class had started.

The problem with 'beginner' and 'advanced' is that those terms have no meaning without a definition of scale. Also, no scale starts with beginner then moves immediately to advanced.

In terms of the way the course is taught, I think that clearer explanations of why we're trying to do something and what we're trying to achieve is fundamental. Without knowing that, all we are doing is copying what the instructor is typing.

If you have an error with your code and have to spend a minute debugging, you're left behind, which means that you're more likely to catch up by just typing what is on the projector. However, in doing that, you only get comfortable with syntax and not with the actual function of the code.  

There's a level of maths required which also was not communicated in the summary. 

In summary: 
- Decide if this is the second course which you have to do after the Beginners course, then communicate that via the SLDU pages
- Potentially break this  into more sessions, or figure out a way to give people more time to really embed the information.

Thanks!"	3

22-Jan-2019			Humanities	A University email list	None	None	None	Data analysis using R	The course was really excellent already. The only thing I can think of is perhaps provide a quick 'cheat sheet' type overview of all the commands etc. used in the course, so that we can have a quick glance at that rather than scroll backwards and forwards if we need to look up something we did earlier in the day.	I think everything, really. We covered a lot, but my problem is always that I forget the commands, so I will have to redo them a couple of times before I memorize them.	Some more statistical tools, i.e. basic descriptive statistics and perhaps some inferential statistics.	Excellent. It is hard to design such a course with people from different backgrounds without going too fast for the newbs and too slow for people who already have some experience. It was an excellent level and pace, at least for me.	5

For example it might have been good to see some illustration of the kinds of things that are possible with R, especially in terms of data visualisation etc..	It would have been good to hear a little more about the different packages available.	It would perhaps have been useful to spend more time discussing how we might use R to clean up 'messy' datasets. (Was the twitter data created using R? If so it would be useful to know how this was done...)	The course materials were excellent - it was useful to have the step by step guide to refer to when completing the exercises and the way in which the course content was delivered was very coherent and easy to follow.

Then suddenly without much introduction some advanced topics such as list comprehension was required to solve challenges. So would have liked to spend less time typing very basic commands and more time on more advanced topics, but I understand that recap is often good and I probably misjudged the level of the course.	Well, the defensive programming was nice, and would like to see more of this, not necessarily go over the same again, but more on unit tests etc.	More advanced topics: Object oriented programming. More on testing, e.g. unit tests. Python concepts such as iterators, decorators, generators. Also whether function inputs are passed by value or reference.	The teacher did a good job and took care to ensure participants were typing along and along with helpers addressed any problems. The course setup is good as typing along makes you learn.	3

Maybe a quick refresher on the terminology at the end of the course (targets / actions / rules / dependencies) etc. But it's not a big deal.

We ran the R code in CSF on the command line, but I was told not to do this, so I thought it was strange we did the example this was.

No point in giving us the post-its if you just gonna fly through the materials anyway. I don't have programming background and have done little prior to starting the PhD so getting the opportunity to speak/ ask questions is quite valuable but I didn't really feel I could as others seems to understand/ pace was too fast.

20-May-2020			Science and Engineering	A Research Software Course at UoM	Python	Git	None	Programming in Python	Made the command line code (i.e. in the command prompt) a little clearer to follow. I thought the conda package management was useful but it needed to be a little clearer.	Numpy image manipulation.	Image segmentation and meshing for FEM.	Workshop was taught and directed well considering the circumstances. Recovered well after a rocky start and I was happy with what I learnt.	4

I thought the course was very well presented but having to use a virtual machine proved problematic. I think if future courses are required to be delivered remotely, it would be good to be provided with a link to the virtual machine say a week prior to the course, so that it can be tested by each individual and a contingency put in place for people to be able to preinstall required software prior to the course on their own machines in case of difficulty connecting to the virtual machines	I thought the addition of anaconda package management content was good and I wouldn't mind going over it again, perhaps with more comparison to pip and why one is better than the other in different situations			4

26-May-2020			Biology, Medicine and Health	CRUK email list	R	None	Comments, Defensive programming	Programming in Python	Improved explanation of what was on the course. Too much demonstration, with not enough time dedicated to why python is a good language for typical analysis we may perform	Defensive programming, as this is broadly applicable	General education about python, rather than specifics which may or may not apply	"The course was poorly structured and seemingly ignorant of the target audience ((data) scientists at Cancer Research UK). As the audience were biologists, I feel like the lessons would have been a lot more effective if the content was demonstrated in a biological context. In addition, the data and analysis performed at CRUK is largely in R, which seems vastly superior to python for analysing tabular data (with the exception of pandas, which essentially emulates base R). This course would have benefitted from highlighting the strength of python by demonstrating its flexibility vs e.g. R

Ultimately, very disappointing, considering that the introduction to python course ~ 2 weeks ago was very well done. I'd also like to thank Anja and Peter(?) for their clarity and help answering questions throughout the session."	1

I will definitely use it as a consulation manual for my projects. On the other side, in my opinion, the zoom session added very little to the written material. It lacked clear and detailed explanation of ""why"" we use certain packages and functions and was simply transcribing the code from the lessons."	2

There is a lot of information to digest (especially for beginnners) and but the course finds a good balance of covering enough information to be useful, without pushing too far.	5

"	I'm going to need to look at it all again on the Library Carpentry site	There wasn't really time to cover any other topics. I was hoping to do the Command prompt lesson, but I'll go back and have a look on Library Carpentry.	This was a well structured, well run, useful course. I am very glad I already had done some Python basics ahead of time because it goes so fast I can see that anyone who is starting from scratch would probably be overwhelmed. This is especially true at the end of the day when the brain is full of Python and can't take more in. I have a colleague who mentioned being interested in the course and will absolutely be recommending it. Thank you for running it. 	5

I *loved* the pandas lesson - but that's mainly because of the kinds of datasets I use in my own work.		I see the Gaussian function equation on lesson 3 didn't map cleanly onto the Python code in the challenge 1 answer (which is for a re-arranged version of that equation) - this made it a little hard (for me at least) to parse the Python code properly and relate it to the equation.	5

Maybe not in this lesson, but an image analysis course would be good.

6/24/2021 16:05:31			Biology, Medicine and Health	Word of mouth	Python, R	None	None	Programming in Python	I found because all the notes were online I could skip ahead and ignore the Zoom call. This was good in a way, but I feel like I probably missed additional explanation in the Zoom call. One idea might be to have limited/simpler notes so that you have to follow along in the Zoom call for the additional explanation, and then release the full notes after the session so you can always go back and look at it in detail. I feel like I would've engaged more with the session if this had been the case. Also I think lists should've come before arrays as I found these simpler to understand.	Combining the data into one large array (e.g. the means from multiple datasets) - I found this a little confusing. 	I suppose good ways of just viewing your data in a table, in case you want to go over it by eye to get a feel for how it is structured/what it feels like. Also different types of visualisations, e.g. box plots etc.	Otherwise enjoyed the course, it forced me to spend a significant amount of time just trying to understand Python, even if I didn't follow along with the session.	4

Perhaps it could be 2 sessions, for those with no previous programming knowledge, and those with some programming knowledge; so more time can be spent in the more advanced sections. The notes will be useful though, and I will use those in my own time. 	Final sections and exercises on those. 		the set up with the virtual desktop, zoom, etc. worked really well.

Data analysis using R	Allow more time for support of people progressing slightly slower so you can get through all the content. 	the 'ifelse' function was to fast to take in properly	renaming variables in your tibble from say 'persons_weight' to 'weight' 	Thanks it was great to dip my toe back in and understand the actual principles I'd clearly forgotten. Very comprehensive for the most part, just a little rushed towards the end. Thank you for sticking around for questions it was helpful but unfortunately I had a testing session to administer so could not stay longer.	4
8/6/2021 13:20:05			Biology, Medicine and Health	StaffNet Learning and Development page	R	None	None	Data analysis using R	give us more practice to do after day 1 	the filter, mutate functions and pipe operator. may be more sophisticated plotting parameters.	It's an introduction but would love to see some simple statistical tests there. definitely could be a 3 day course or a 2 days of 5 or 6 hours with more breaks . 	Thank you so much, Kamilla, Peter and David.  Best instructors 	5

8/6/2021 13:28:00			Biology, Medicine and Health	StaffNet Learning and Development page	None	None	None	Data analysis using R	Less people in the course perhaps 	 plotting of graphs	would have liked the option to go through more complex datasets e.g. RNA sequencing analysis, however understand this could be a course in and of itself	Overall good course, thank you - particularly useful for knowledge of where to access hints/tips/teaching materials.	5
8/6/2021 13:30:32			Biology, Medicine and Health	StaffNet Learning and Development page	Stata	None	None	Data analysis using R	It was difficult to relate to the relevance of much of the earlier work/code.  It would have helped if this had been explained early on	Creating and editing graphs	Tips and tools for data cleaning in R 	Breaks did not occur as often as originally stated and made it difficult to nip to loo etc	4
8/7/2021 18:39:00			Science and Engineering	StaffNet Learning and Development page	R	None	None	Data analysis using R	Better connecting topics. I got a bit lost a few times when trying to explain new functions, but I was not sure if the previous explanation/example was finished.	The last part on graphics and the use of ggplot.	I think it would be useful to see the ggplot part more in detail.	I did like the course in general. It was useful for me as a refreshment for R and better know how to use RStudio (which I never used before).	4

There were a few technical problems but you can't really do anything about that. Pacing was a little fast in the final part as a result	Sections 10-12	If  i remember correctly we didn't get a chance to cover the last couple of sections	Gerard was enthusiastic and patient in explaining the technicalities.	5

10/14/2021 16:36:46			Biology, Medicine and Health	Supervisor	None	None	None	Introduction to Python	Possibly have over two days so it's less of an information overload and can spend a bit more time on the later topics.	The figure code (matplotlib.pyplot).	I don't know much about programming yet so don't really know what else could be covered- I thought this covered a lot of good topics though.	The course was really good overall, explained really well- I understood almost everything and have never used Python before. There was a good amount of breaks as well so it wasn't too overwhelming.	5
10/15/2021 10:19:37			Science and Engineering	StaffNet Learning and Development page	MATLAB, Bash	None	Comments, Sub-programs (e.g. functions, subroutines, methods, procedures)	Introduction to Python	It would have been great to have access to the material much ahead of time, so that we could work through the lessons/exercises in our own time and only bring up problems	Further exercises			4
10/27/2021 15:59:35			Biology, Medicine and Health	StaffNet Learning and Development page	R, Stata, Bash	None	None	Introduction to the UNIX shell	Morning was a bit slow and afternoon a bit rushed so perhaps just changing the timings	Writing bash programmes	Using iCSF would have been helpful for me	I would prefer face to face workshops instead of zoom	5

More practical use of the information shown could also be mentioned more.	Just reviewing it all over by using the course notes.	Not sure.	No, thank you!	5
10/27/2021 16:02:51			Biology, Medicine and Health	Supervisor	None	None	None	Introduction to the UNIX shell	I thought the course was really good and very well taught- I would maybe just suggest having it over two days as so much information at once was hard to take in by the end.	I think all of it was equally well taught so couldn't choose one thing.		The online notes were really good.	5
10/27/2021 16:10:00			Biology, Medicine and Health	StaffNet Learning and Development page	Python	None	None	Introduction to the UNIX shell	Potentially have a longer break in the afternoon where the content is more difficult and you're more overwhelmed by the amount of new information. This might help my brain recover a bit before attempting harder questions. 	Explanation of technical terms such as variables, commands, arguments etc. 	N/A	I really enjoyed the session overall, it was structured very well and had a good balance between teaching and working through example questions. The notes were really helpful to have as well, and gave added context to the commands we were learning. 	4

I found the functions part a bit tricky and then we rushed through it a bit.	Functions	manipulation of the plots e.g. adding std error bars but I understand that I can do some research here on my own		5
11/3/2021 16:41:53			Science and Engineering	StaffNet Learning and Development page	MATLAB, Python, Bash	None	Comments	Introduction to MATLAB	Providing us with the curiculum in advance, so that we could join in at relevent times rather than sit through the entire session and go over certain parts we were already familiar with.	Defensive Programming		It was somewhat tight for time, which left out the more challenging parts of the lesson. Maybe the first two chapters we could have done ahead, in our own time, so that more attention could be given to the later material?	4

The workshop was really helpful - thanks!	4

It felt very different to the first part especially when working remotely. 	The parallel processing - perhaps a more illustrative case study.	Condor services	Brilliant training with lots of support in the breakout rooms	4

11/23/2021 15:51:05			Science and Engineering	Supervisor	MATLAB, Python	None	None, Unsure what this is. I use the Turbomole module for Density Functional Theory calculations.	Introduction to HPC using CSF	It might be useful to ask before the session what modules the attendees use and try to tailor some slides towards those modules if possible. Could be a big ask if there's many people attending.	maybe not quite an answer to the question but I found the first session not too useful. There was a lot about the CSF backend which we didn't really need to know aside from the nice slide about the batch system, job queue and login node etc. I would rather we went over the things from the second session more i.e. parallel submissions to specific cores, finding out what cores work best for our modules etc.	I personally would've liked some Turbomole  on the CSF specific content but that doesn't work for everyone.		4

Maybe loops? I don't think I fully got it but I have the notes so I can easily go back through it myself if needed.	It would be cool to go through the entire course, but I know time is limited. 	I really appreciated how organised everything was. It was nice to just log in and get down to it!	5

12/14/2021 16:20:06			Biology, Medicine and Health	StaffNet Learning and Development page	None	None	None	Introduction to Python	The session felt quite time pressured and rushed towards the end so it was easy to lose focus. Perhaps less emphasis should be made on how quickly we have to work through the items. 	The longer chunks of code, e.g. creating figures. 	N/A	N/A	4
12/14/2021 16:28:22			PSS	StaffNet Learning and Development page	None	Something else	None	Introduction to Python	Rather than reading from a script, which I could have done by myself, I would have expected to be given a bit more context and more explanation as to why we are performing certain functions. I was able to follow it on screen and replicate it on my own laptop but I couldn't understand the context of it and the why.	Probably the whole thing in my own time supported by other complementary reading.		"Very packed day with a lot to cover. As this is an intro course, I'd expect to be given more time and more in-depth info with better explanations in each section and have it split into 2 smaller sessions, rather than rushing through the whole thing.
The supplementary / reading / exercises material seems good and I would like to revisit."	3
12/14/2021 16:45:42			Humanities	Research IT newsletter (researchitnews.org)	None	None	None	Introduction to Python	Perhaps a slightly faster pace at the start, to allow a bit more time to be spent on the more complex ideas towards the end. 	Last section, on functions		The SW carpentry materials seem very useful, so it's useful to know they are there, for future self-study. The instructor did very well to keep going for what is a long online course, without much audience interaction or visibility. It was good to have the two helpers on hand to deal with queries in the chat. 	4
12/14/2021 16:51:51			Science and Engineering	StaffNet Learning and Development page	R	None	Comments	Introduction to Python	Can't think of anything sorry!	All topics were comprehensive and well explained. The one that surprised me was creating a new variable from an existing variable (primes = odds) acts like a symbolic link. Coming from R I'll have to watch out for this one.			5
12/14/2021 17:38:08			Science and Engineering	StaffNet Learning and Development page	Python	None	Assertions (pre- and post-conditions)	Introduction to Python	I do not know if its possible but if the instructor can monitor our workspace during the exercises it may really help better understanding. 	Creating Functions section	More practical examples may help to exercise after the lesson. I personally, really enjoy all session but currently do not use coding in my research or any part of my daily life, so have concerns about forgetting things I learned today. If the lesson cover more practical examples, such using mathematical functions or solving some statistic problems, may really help to continue practicing afterwards. 	It was very useful and informative, course, much appreciate your efforts to deliver it virtually.  	5
12/21/2021 11:31:34			PSS	StaffNet Learning and Development page	VB	Something else	Comments, Sub-programs (e.g. functions, subroutines, methods, procedures)	Introduction to Python	I think it was a great course, but i think a wider scope into Python instead of individual datasets. would have been good, I work in finance and would like to learn ways of working better with Data, i know of Python having some great uses.	Great Teacher, useful tool	further using datasets, what can and cant you have in a CSV file for example?		5
